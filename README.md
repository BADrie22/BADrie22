Hey, Anvith Shenoy B here. You can call me Badri as well. 
Since you stumbled upon my github profile, I'd like to introduce myself properly this time. 

Hello, I am Anvith Shenoy, a MCA student at St. Joseph Engineering College, Vamanjoor, Mangalore. 
I love designing stuff, either CSS or Photoshop. And, yes I'm an artist. I hope to become the best full-stack graphic designer someday. 
You may come across my work through https://www.dribbble.com/badrie22. 

I was also a BCA student at Canara College, Mangaluru. BCA made a huge impact on my future. You may say I can code pretty decent, while my friends and family exaggerate about me being something better. Or so I hear frequent. Overall, you may say I am pretty confident about my stuff. 

I took part in the IT Manager events held at AIMIT, Kotekar and NMAMIT, Nitte. Sadly, only reached the finals never winning either of them. Wondering if I ever will win any events. 

You may further initiate contact with me through badrinathshenoy22@gmail.com.
